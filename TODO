PERF:
Use buffered io? Optionally? When would you flush?
Move high throughput connections to their own connections
Use a ring buffer?
Mitigate allocation of windowupdates (pool?)

DOCS:
Write a more extensive example
Document the muxado wire protocol

TESTING:
tests for heartbeat
tests for typedstream
test for stream exhaustion
test for short read of data frame
tests for window manager
tests for buffer
re-enable stream tests
re-enable frame tests
More session tests
More stream tests
Write frame/framer tests - verify read correct type, verify unknown type causes error, verify proper errors

### Low priority:
window_manager needs to support a deadline
add Reset() stream API?
eliminate unlikely race on s.remoteDebug between handleFrame() and die()
don't send reset if the stream is fully closed
