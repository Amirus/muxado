For launch:
include muxado pun somewhere

Add support for extensions
Add heartbeat
Handle case of running out of stream ids + test
writeFrame errors should kill the session, but only if it's not a timeout + test
Short read should cause an error + test
Decrement() in outBuffer needs to have deadline support

Finish writing buffer tests
Write stress test
Write multi-frame write test
More session tests
More stream tests
Write frame/transport tests - verify read correct type, verify unknown type causes error, verify ioerror is propogated
Write frame/syn tests
Write frame/goaway tests

### Low priority:
- Add the ability to differentiate stream errors which allow you to safely retry
- Decide what to do if the application isn't handling its accepted streams fast enough. Refuse stream? Wait and block reading more frames?
- Figure out whether to die with/without lock - in GoAway/OpenStream
- Add priority APIs to stream
- Add priority extension
- Add Reset() stream API
- Eliminate unlikely race on s.remoteDebug between handleFrame() and die()
- Should writeFrame calls for rst/wndinc set the write deadline?
- don't send reset if the stream is fully closed
